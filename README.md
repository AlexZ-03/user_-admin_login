A simple yet powerful web application for managing user accounts, built with Express.js, MongoDB, and Node.js. This project demonstrates how to create a role-based login system where admins can manage users, edit details, and delete accounts.


üìã Features
User Registration and Login: Secure authentication for users, with hashed passwords using bcrypt.
Admin Dashboard: Admin users can view, edit, and delete user accounts.
Role-Based Access Control: Only admin users have access to the dashboard and editing features.
Session Management: Persistent sessions using express-session to maintain login state.
Responsive Design: Clean, minimalistic interface for easy navigation and functionality.


üîß Technologies Used
Backend: Express.js (Node.js)
Database: MongoDB
Templating: EJS
Authentication: bcrypt for password hashing
CSS Framework: Basic styling for the interface (optional to mention if any specific framework)

ü§î Why This Project?
This project helped me understand the basics of session handling, role-based access control, and CRUD operations with MongoDB. It also demonstrates how to secure user data with password hashing and manage user data efficiently with Express and MongoDB.
